# Why? (motivation)

Materials data development is incremental. Everone takes small steps
and it is only by communication rapid groth can be obtained.

**amdata.proj.kth.se** is a collaborative backbone.

# Share your results

and you will recieve a multitude of information.


# The future needs data too

By saving current data future development will be in uptempo!


# How does data look like?

- A multitude of file formats
	- some even propriatary
- Fairly often just fragments
- Naming is not uniform
- data is spread over several HDs and servers
- duplicates yield uncertenty
- no version control
- ...


# amdata.proj.kth.se

- It is a server and a Database
- code developed by NIST in MGI
- based on open packages (django, mongoDB, ...)
- hosted by KTH-IT 
	- (fantastic bandwidth)

# Features of amdata

	- Alt. some templates to use from
	- **Note:** not definitive! updata will come later

- Use it all.



# Agenda Day 1

<!-- Computers is a must -->
<!-- Everybody should think in advance on the amount of data and -->
<!-- the structure of it. Just to make it easier to make templates -->
