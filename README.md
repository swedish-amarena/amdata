## Swedish Arena for Additive Manufacturing of Metals

The Arena is a membership programme for Swedish actors in the field of
Additive Manufacturing of Metals. The Arena's ambition is to be a
meeting point for all key players and together develop the future 
of metal-AM in Sweden.

The aim of the Swedish Arena for Additive Manufacturing of Metals is
to:

- Develop a strong network in metal-AM between the participating partners
- Monitor and contribute to the development of technology and knowledge
- Provide easy access to test and demo platforms in metal-AM
- Support and accelerate industrialization of metal-AM

The objective of the Arena is to create a vehicle for open innovation to enable innovative
product development and manufacturing to support applied R&D in industrial metal additive
manufacturing.
